Modeling Equivalent Circuits for Experimental Time, Voltage, and Current Data

We designed a program with a graphical user interface for plotting experimental data for a supercapacitor 
device as well as modeling the system as an RC circuit, spitting out a fitted plot and values for the 
resistances and capacitance included in the model circuit.
